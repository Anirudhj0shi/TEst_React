<h1>Test React</h1>
<h2>Question no. 1 -> Counter </h2>
<p>This code is a React functional component named Counter. It utilizes the useState hook to maintain a count state initialized to 0.

Within the component, it returns a div with a h1 displaying the current count state. Two buttons are present: one to increment the count by 1 when clicked, and another to decrement the count by 1 when clicked. Both buttons use the onClick event handler to update the count state accordingly by utilizing the setCount function provided by the useState hook. The setCount function is called with a callback function that takes the current count value as an argument and returns the updated count value based on whether the increment or decrement button was clicked.

The UI elements in the code are structured in a way that allows users to interact with the buttons to increase or decrease the displayed count value.
